Grading scale mechanism:

| Score | Explanation |
| ----- | ----------- |
|  10   | You literally have written a book. |
| 7 - 9 | Expert, go-to person on this technology. |
| 5 - 6 | Solid daily working knowledge. Highly proficient. |
| 3 - 4 | Comfortable working with this, have to check manual on some things. |
| 1 - 2 | Have worked with it previously but either not much, or rusty. |

(Copied from <https://www.cirosantilli.com/skills>, thanks Ciro!)

However, since I'm only an amateur CS student without too many years of *solid* development experiences
(without the word *solid*, I may say 8 years, but with it, I'd go with only 5 years, being conservative),
I'm very hesitant to give myself a single 5 score on anything,
because I still need to occasionally check manuals and documentations on many technologies I work with.
For this reason, instead of numbers, I'll show the scores with stars.
One ★ means one score (and it's also more intuitive to look at).

Ordered at my own discretion, what I deem more important goes first :)

## Software Programming

<dl class="rating-table">
<dt>C++ #3#</dt>
<dd>
[Stack Overflow activity](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A5958455+%5Bc%2B%2B%5D) (also my top tag as of May 2019)

Reason for not giving a fourth score: I'm not particularly familiar with STL and I haven't participated in a scaled C++ project. This should be considered a downside as I'm familiar with C++ syntax and many sneaky language features (and that's where my Stack Overflow score under the \[c++\] tag primarily comes from).
</dd>

<dt>C #4#</dt>
<dd>
[Stack Overflow activity](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A5958455+%5Bc%5D) (also my second top tag as of May 2019) and [my <i class="fab fa-github"></i> repositories](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3AiBug+language%3Ac)

<dd>
[Stack Overflow activity](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A5958455+%5Bbash%5D) and [a collection of my gadgets](https://github.com/iBug/shGadgets) written in Bash or POSIX `sh`.
</dd>

</dd>

<dt>SQL #1#</dt>

Barely touched Ruby, write short snippets to aid existing Ruby projects (my Jekyll website or other Rails apps)
</dd>

<dt>Verilog #1#</dt>

Learned from school courses *Digital Circuit labs* and *Computer Organization and Design labs*. Not practiced much
</dd>

<dt>Scala / Chisel #1#</dt>
<dd>
Assigned a research on Chisel for performing particularly well in *Digital Circuit labs*, and have worked on a few entry-level projects ([my COD <i class="fab fa-github"></i> repo](https://github.com/iBug/COD-2019) and [this RISC-V project](https://github.com/iBug/USTC-RV-Chisel)).

<dd>

## Tools and technologies

<dl class="rating-table">
<dt>Git #3#</dt>
<dd>
I was about to give myself a score of 5 on this when I realized that Ciro Santilli claimed the same score, but backed with [a huge tutorial](https://www.cirosantilli.com/git-tutorial/) he wrote on his own.
Then I reevaluated myself and gave a score of only 3 - I can't even write a fifth of Ciro's tutorial.
</dd>

<dt>Linux #3#</dt>
<dd>
Daily working environment (WSL) with enough supporting knowledge. Ironically, I don't have a preferred desktop environment because I mostly work in CLI. I have a few Ubuntu and Debian servers that I maintain personally, including a <i class="fab fa-raspberry-pi"></i> Raspberry Pi.

What about checking out [my tmux config](https://ibug.github.io/ext/conf/tmux.conf)?
</dd>

<dt>Windows Desktop #4#</dt>
<dd>
Long since I was 12 I began to learn various configurations and tweaks (primarily the Registry) of Windows XP and Windows 7, which helped build my solid knowledge on Windows setup, maintenance and recovery.

Still using a Windows laptop (by MSI) for day-to-day working, yet heavily relies on WSL.
</dd>

<dt>Docker #2#</dt>
<dd>
My favorite application deployment solution, but haven't got much experience with it. I also have private CIs running in Docker containers.
</dd>

<dt>Make #1#</dt>
<dd>
My preferred build automation system. Usually writes `Makefile` for personal projects.
</dd>

<dt>NGINX #1#</dt>
</dl>

## Other

<dl class="rating-table">
<dt>Hardware maintenance #3#</dt>
<dd>
I assembled several desktop computers, and I maintain all my hardware on my own, ranging from my laptop to my phones. I send them to repair shops only when I identify that I can't repair or replace it by myself.

- I disassembled new laptop even on day 1 of puechase, usually for an immediate upgrade (e.g. SSD 256 GB &rarrow; 1 TB). (Dec 2018)
- I replaced a broken screen of an old phone manually. (Oct 2016)
- I dismantaled a HDD to learn how it worked. (April 2016)
- I assembled my first desktop computer from parts. (May 2014)
</dd>

<dt>Cryptography #2#</dt>
<dd>
My specialty in CTF competitions.
