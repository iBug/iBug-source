Master student majoring in CS at [USTC][USTC], hobbiest programmer and passionate geek. Mostly a developer and Linux system administrator.

  [USTC]: https://en.ustc.edu.cn/

Python, C, C++ and Go are my primary options for course labs and new projects, though I always like trying something new (and that's why I have a little bit of taste of everything).

Also loves casual gaming, puzzle gaming, and Counter-Strike 2.

## In action

I'm an active contributor on GitHub across various repositories, and *the* current maintainer of [Minimal Mistakes][mm]. You can see a list of [my open-source contributions][open-source] if you're interested.

I'm also an avid user on Stack Overflow:

### Working environment

My <span class="svg-inline" style="transform: translateY(0.166667em);">{% include assets/desktop.svg %}</span> headless workstation in office is equipped with Ryzen 9 5950X, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Docker, LXD, KVM (libvirt), plus all the bells and whistles, and I do my work over SSH (and [VS Code Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)) every day.

[Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) is the *best* terminal for Windows.

MSI produces high-performance gaming laptops with very comfortable and beautiful keyboards and *used to* be my personal preference.
