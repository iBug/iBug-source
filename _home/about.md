Master student majoring in CS at [USTC][USTC], hobbiest programmer and passionate geek. Mostly a developer and Linux system administrator.

  [USTC]: https://en.ustc.edu.cn/

Python, C, C++ and Go are my primary options for course labs and new projects, though I always like trying something new (and that's why I have a little bit of taste of everything).

Also loves casual and puzzle gaming.

## In action

I'm an active contributor on GitHub across various repositories, and *the* current maintainer of [Minimal Mistakes][mm]. You can see a list of all my pull requests [using GitHub search][all-prs].

I'm also an avid user on Stack Overflow:
