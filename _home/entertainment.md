### Microsoft Solitaire Collection

I play MSC a lot so it is worth a dedicated section for description. (Xbox User ID: `iBugOne`)

Here are my stats:

{% include gallery id="gallery-msc" %}

I particularly like FreeCell and I've completed all FC challenges in Star Club. The Expert level FC games are very enjoyable!

### Minesweeper

I started practicing Minesweeper when I was 15, and I can complete a Hard board (30x16, 99 mines) within 3 minutes (personal best 162 sec). I also have the record of completing a Hard board **without using flags** **on a touchscreen** in less than 6 minutes.

## Music

- Various game OSTs:
  - *Plants vs. Zombies* (2009) OST ([Video Game Music](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/plants-vs.-zombies))
  - *Stardew Valley* OST ([Buy from <i class="fab fa-fw fa-steam"></i> Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440820/Stardew_Valley_Soundtrack/))

## Movies & TV

- [*Mr. Bean* series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Im2I6STbms&list=PLN0WNYpy2vjI3EWQG1YXHSIoAMvmDgYTX) from the 1990s
  - I particularly like the scene where Mr. Bean drives off sitting on the roof of his Mini. ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6VaYr7xOsw&t=12m11s))
  - Also includes the movie *Bean* (1997).
- *Johnny English* (2003), also by Rowan Atkinson
- Most (if not all) documentaries by David Attenborough, BBC, such as *Planet Earth* series and *Blue Planet* series
- *The Lion King* (1994), but **not** the 2019-refurbished version
- *The Big Bang Theory*
