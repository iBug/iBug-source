A RISC-V-centric project aiming to pave the way for its application in school teaching,
across several courses, including *Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)*, *Computer Organization and Design (COD)* and more.
It consists of a RISC-V-based SoC design (hardware) and a full set of toolchain to compile C programs for the SoC,
with the hope that this project will help joining many hardcore CS courses into one streamline of comprehension,
greatly improve students' understanding of CS principles and their competence in future research and careers.

It is currently under development.
