A community-driven chatbot that detects spam across the Stack Exchange Network and reports them, so they can be quickly removed.

I joined the team in December 2017, and [was recognized as a developer](/p/3) in March 2018.

This is the largest project in this page and also the first existing project that I've joined (all other projects are started from scratch).
