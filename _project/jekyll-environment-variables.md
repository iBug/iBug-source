A Jekyll plugin that enables the use of environment variables in Liquid templates.
I have published it [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-environment-variables) and it has accumulated a total download of 25k,
which IMO indicates its non-trivial impact to the Jekyll community.
It also gathered some discussion on its [issue board](https://github.com/iBug/jekyll-environment-variables/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).
