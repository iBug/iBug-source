This November I found a discount from one of my favorite VPS providers, [NETfront][aff]. They offered **Linux VPS with 2 vCPUs and 2 GB RAM** at HK$56/mo, and also **Windows VPS with 4 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM** at HK$49/mo. Looks strange, right? Why buy the crappy Linux VPS when you can have a better configuration with *less* money (if possible)?

**Note**: I knew this VPS provider ran [Proxmox VE][pve] because I already had their VPSs. They'd give you a Proxmox VE noVNC console when you click "Console" to manage your VPS, from which you know they're using QEMU/KVM as their virtualization platform. Direct access to QEMU screen is *awesome*!

## Get a VPS {#get-vps}

First I head to the shopping cart to order a Windows VPS.

![VPS SKU item](/image/linux/ipxe/vps-buy.png){: .border style="border-radius: 12px;" }

Nice offer. It comes with unlimited traffic rate limited to 20 Mbps (BTW, it's full duplex using Proxmox VE's built-in "Rate Limit" feature for QEMU/KVM). I complete an order and get to create a VM for this service.

Completely expected, only Windows images are available for choosing.

That doesn't matter, since I'm prepared to bypass the provided VM images and set it up on my own, so I picked *Disabled* for KVM OS Template. Hopefully it'll speed up the VM creation process a bit, which, well, wouldn't matter after all ðŸ˜Š.

The next part involves a bit of patient waiting. The VM creation took quite a few minutes, perhaps to reserve that 128 GB of HDD? It would probably make sense to wipe the reserved area lest any previous data be left behind, which is a good practice in terms of security. Whatever, now the new VPS is ready, and I can see some basic information about it. I take down the IP address because later in iPXE environment I need to configure it as a static IP address.

Because I did not choose an OS template for the VPS, it must boot from network (which is true even if I *did* take a template).

Now it's time to start working!

## Network booting with iPXE

iPXE is an open-source PXE (network boot) firmware, and is built into QEMU, ready for use.

I open up the noVNC console and start the VPS. When I see "Press ESC for Boot Menu", I go for it for the iPXE menu.

![iPXE boot screen](/image/linux/ipxe/ipxe-boot.png)

iPXE tries to configure network automatically using DHCP, but since the VPS environment does not have DHCP, I have to manually configure the network.

![iPXE configure IP address](/image/linux/ipxe/ipxe-config.png)

Now it's time to load some boot source. [Netboot.xyz][netboot] is the first Google result for "public pxe boot server", so I'll trust it for good.

#### <i class="fas fa-bug"></i> Trap
{: .no_toc }

I previously got trapped following its [quick start][netboot.quickstart] guide. It didn't boot for me and just dropped network connection mid-way. Turns out the [*Boot using iPXE*][netboot] guide is the one I should follow.
</div>

According to [Netboot.xyz documentation][netboot], the only command needed after network is up is `chain`. Noting that the iPXE firmware built into QEMU does not support HTTPS, I use plaintext HTTP instead. The final commands used in iPXE environment are here:

```shell
set net0/ip 192.0.2.2           # Replace with your IP address
set net0/netmask 255.255.255.0  # Replace as needed
set net0/gateway 192.0.2.1      # Replace with your gateway address
set dns 8.8.8.8
ifopen net0
chain --autofree http://boot.netboot.xyz
```

Within a few seconds, I see the OS selection screen.

Debian has always been my #1 choice for servers, no reason to miss it. Select Linux Network Installs and look for Debian Bullseye.

![Debian network installer](/image/linux/ipxe/ipxe-install-debian.png)

Now I'm halfway to success as Debian installer shows up. There's still a small note: the Debian installer doesn't "inherit" network settings from the iPXE firmware, so it must be configured again for Debian. The auto configuration attempt will fail and Debian will prompt for manual configuration. Not any difficult.

![Configure network for Debian installer](/image/linux/ipxe/ipxe-install-debian-network.png)

Now it's time to wipe Windows (where's Windows?) and install Linux!

![Configure disk partitions for Debian](/image/linux/ipxe/ipxe-install-debian-disk.png)

Select `deb.debian.org` as package source since this is a Hong Kong VPS and not a mainland China one, and proceed through the rest of the process. After a reboot, I can see the login screen of the newly installed OS. Hooray!

![Debian ready](/image/linux/ipxe/debian-ok.png)

If I replace `linux-image-amd64` with `linux-image-cloud-amd64`, I can free up some 100 MB disk space than the default setup:

![Debian DF](/image/linux/ipxe/debian-df.png)

That's it. With just some small efforts, this is now an afforable, high-spec Linux VPS.

While the VPS control panel would never offer Linux templates should anything go wrong, it's always possible to boot from iPXE again for a "rescue environment".

## Easter Egg

During Debian installation, the installer automatically added the `hyperv-daemon` package after examining hardware. After booting into Debian, `systemd-detect-virt` reports "microsoft" (i.e. Windows Hyper-V). This VPS hosting provider may have some black magic with their Windows VPS cluster so that QEMU/KVM behaves so. This issue doesn't seem to exist in their "native" Linux VPS, but it's worth noting.
