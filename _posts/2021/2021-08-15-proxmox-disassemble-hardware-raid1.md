Yesterday in a server maintenance period, we decided to tune the storage layout of our Proxmox VE server, which included disassembling a RAID 1 array and adjusting the size of the root filesystem.

## Backup data

As is always, potentially destructive disk operations should be preceded with a backup of anything necessary for recovery.
{: .notice--danger }

Proxmox VE uses a kind of "standard" partition layout, with the first 512 MB of the primary disk allocated for the EFI System Partition (ESP), and the rest forming an LVM physical volume (PV), which then becomes a volume group (VG) named `pve`. In the `pve` VG, a fifth of total available space is allocated to the root filesystem for the Proxmox VE system, and the rest goes to a thin pool named `data`.

The initial disk layout on our server is like this:

![Initial disk layout](/image/proxmox-raid1/initial-fdisk.png)

The system is booted with UEFI, so the first partition can be safely ignored. The second partition is the ESP and contains no critical data, as it can be rebuilt when needed. The only thing left for backup is the rootfs since we haven't made use of the `data` volume. A good news is that the rootfs only has less then 3.5 GB of content (we have separate storages for the system and our virtual machines), so backing up is as easy as allocating a 4 GB volume on our data storage and copying the whole rootfs over with [Rsync](https://www.samba.org/rsync/):

```shell
rsync -aHAXx / /mnt/backup/
```

In addition, it's been said in [this Super User answer](https://superuser.com/a/137310/688600) that

> Of course, it may be a complete jerk for you and wipe the drives for no good reason, but this is very unlikely.

So we might not even need that backup (in fact we didn't). After all, it's better safe than sorry, isn't it?

## Disassembling the RAID array {#disassemble-array}

The standard procedure for this is to reboot into BIOS setup and change the settings there.

I reboot the server, hitting F9 on its POST screen.

![HPE POST Screen](/image/proxmox-raid1/hpe-enter-bios.png)

Next, I locate the built-in RAID controller. It's called "HPE Smart Array". I navigate into the options, locate the RAID-1 array, and select "Delete Array". It completes just in a flash.

![HPE Array Setting](/image/proxmox-raid1/hpe-bios-array-setting.png)

To ensure the changes take effect, I reboot the server again.

## Restore the partition table {#restore-partitions}

Because the disks may previously contain some RAID information at their start, their content may not be recognized now, so I insert a virtual CD-ROM drive using the "Virtual Media" feature provided by the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC, also known as IPMI). It's good we have a file server providing these handy resources. As the host system has been updated to [Proxmox VE 7](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Roadmap#Proxmox_VE_7.0), I picked the new Debian Bullseye Live CD instead of Buster. This ensures I can start the server for disk recovery jobs.

![Insert ISO from IPMI](/image/proxmox-raid1/set-virtual-media.png)

This time I enter "One-Time Boot Menu" to boot from the CD-ROM. I select "iLO Virtual CD-ROM" and it starts up.

![Select boot item](/image/proxmox-raid1/hpe-bios-boot-from-iso.png)

In a few seconds, the Debian boot screen shows up.

![Debian Bullseye GRUB screen](/image/linux/debian-11-livecd.png)

Now I can run `fdisk` to check the disk status. As expected, no partitions are found.

Given that the "Delete Array" operation completes so quickly, I'm sure it did nothing to data stored on the disk, so I can try recovering the partition table. [`testdisk`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/testdisk) is one of the utilities that do this job.

![Disk layout after disassembly](/image/proxmox-raid1/after-disassembly-fdisk.png)

The terminal interface of testdisk is straightforward. Select the only disk given (`/dev/sda`, the one you gave it as CLI argument), select the previous partition table type (testdisk tells you if it can find out, which matches that in the first image of this article), and select "Analyze".

![Testdisk select disk type](/image/proxmox-raid1/testdisk-disk-type.png)

If testdisk found a partition table in the previous screen, the analyze step doesn't need a second - it will just show the discovered partition. If it didn't find anything, you can still run "Quick Search" and get your partition table back.

![Testdisk partition analysis](/image/proxmox-raid1/testdisk-analysis.png)

In my case, I just select "Backup" and proceed to next step. Testdisk is smart enough to discard the first nonsense partition (it's completely redundant on a UEFI system), and I'm left with two.

![Testdisk found partitions](/image/proxmox-raid1/testdisk-overview.png)

There's no change I need to make at this stage, so I just proceed to the final screen and let testdisk write the partition table.

![Testdisk confirm partitions](/image/proxmox-raid1/testdisk-confirm.png)

Although testdisk tells me "*You will have to reboot for the change to take effect*", calling `partprobe` is all that's necessary. Now I can confirm with `fdisk` that the partition table has been restored.

![Restored disk layout](/image/proxmox-raid1/restored-fdisk.png)

`partprobe` doesn't come with Debian Bullseye live CD (it did with Debian Buster). To get the command I installed `parted` package.
{: .notice--info }

## Shrinking the root filesystem {#shrink-rootfs}

It's a complete waste to give the rootfs a whopping 96 GB when we only use some 3.5 GB, so I go to shrink it down to 16 GB.

Before shrinking the volume, it's necessary to shrink the *filesystem* first. Yes, a "partition" and a "filesystem" are two different concepts.

The rootfs of Proxmox VE resides in LVM, so the first thing is to get LVM tools up and running. I tried `apt install lvm2`, and was (a bit) surprised to found that it came with Debian Bullseye Live CD.

I get back the VG `pve` by `vgscan`, and make all LVs available for operation by `vgchange -ay pve`. I can then mount `/dev/pve/root` somewhere and check the volume usage with `df -h`. Just around 4 gigs, we're good.

Many years ago I read [this blog by Matt Berther](https://matt.berther.io/2015/02/03/how-to-resize-aws-ec2-ebs-volumes/) about shrinking EBS volumes on AWS EC2. The same solution is still applicable here (though years of Linux experience relieved me of the need for the blog as a reference).

I unmount the rootfs and run `e2fsck -f /dev/pve/root` to ensure a clean state of the filesystem, followed by `resize2fs -M -p /dev/pve/root` to perform the shrinking.

![Shrinking rootfs](/image/proxmox-raid1/shrink-rootfs.png)

After the filesystem is shrunk, I shrink the logical volume with `lvresize -L 16G pve/root`. Then I grow the filesystem back to the full size of the volume with `resize2fs -p /dev/pve/root` (without the `-M` option).

![Restore rootfs](/image/proxmox-raid1/grow-rootfs.png)

## Restoring rootfs to "RAID" state {#convert-rootfs-to-mirrored}

The main reason we set up RAID 1 for these disks is to provide resilience against disk failures, so we can still have the system running if either disk dies. Completely breaking up the RAID array defeats this purpose, so it's helpful to at least add the rootfs back to the mirrored state.

Luckily, [LVM provides the ability][lvm-mirror] to create mirrored volumes. Converting an existing one is even easier:

  [lvm-mirror]: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/mirror_create

```shell
lvconvert -m1 pve/root
```

The command failed for an obvious reason: There's only one disk in the VG.

Recalling that a RAID 1 array has just been broken up, there's `/dev/sdb` with an identical partition structure available. I repeat the same steps to recover the partition table on `/dev/sdb`, and wiped `/dev/sdb2` to avoid conflict. I can then add it to the VG as a second PV:

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb2 bs=1M count=1
pvcreate /dev/sdb2
vgextend pve /dev/sdb2
```

Now I can convert the rootfs to "mirrored" volume.

![Extend volume group](/image/proxmox-raid1/extend-vg.png)

The "data" volume can also be extended to take all remaining space as well:

```shell
lvextend -l +100%FREE pve/data
```

## Fixing up GRUB {#fix-grub}

To ensure the system can boot up normally, GRUB should be updated. This needs to be done in chroot inside the original system environment. A bunch of mounts must be setup for GRUB reinstallation to work.

```shell
mount /dev/pve/root /srv

# systemd-udev requires these two directories to be available
mount -o rbind /run /srv/run
mount -o rbind /tmp /srv/tmp

chroot /srv
mount -t devtmpfs _ /dev
mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
mount -t proc _ /proc
mount -t sysfs _ /sys
```

Now I can replace `grub-pc` with `grub-efi` with `apt install grub-efi`, and then run `grub-install` on both `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1` so that both disks are bootable.

## Fixing up ramdisk {#fix-initrd}

This paragraph tells a trap I encountered. If you're following this article as a step-by-step guide, you can skip this paragraph and do this instead:

1. Either install `mdadm`, or
2. Edit `/etc/initramfs-tools/modules` and append two lines `dm_raid` and `raid1`.

After picking an action above, run `update-initramfs -u -k all` and you can proceed to rebooting from the live CD.
</div>

Looking at the checklist, everything should have been taken care of, so I reboot the server. The Proxmox GRUB screen passed as normal. To my surprise, the server is stuck at *Loading initial ramdisk*.

To display more information for troubleshooting, I reboot the server again, pressing `e` on the GRUB screen so I can edit the boot item. I remove `quiet` and added `nomodeset` to the kernel command line (see [Ask Ubuntu][kernel-parameters]), and hit Ctrl-X to boot. This does turn up something useful:

  [kernel-parameters]: https://askubuntu.com/q/716957/612877

![Debug output for Loading initial ramdisk](/image/proxmox-raid1/loading-initial-ramdisk-nomodeset.png)

Google search for "raid: failed to run raid array" brings me to [this Ask Ubuntu question](https://askubuntu.com/q/292092/612877). Checking the answers and the comments, I reboot again into Debian Live CD, mount the rootfs, install `mdadm`, and `update-initramfs` again. The next reboot proved correct, and the Proxmox VE server is back up now.
