OpenSSH 8.2 is coming to the latest Long-Term Service release of Ubuntu, Focal Fossa (20.04), and has some breaking changes for users using [an SSH Certificate Authority]({{ '/p/30' | relative_url }}).

With OpenSSH 8.1 or older, the default certificate type when signing with `ssh-keygen` is `ssh-rsa`, although ECDSA- and SHA2-based algorithms have been supported since OpenSSH 5.7. As cited in the [release notes][openssh-8.2],

> It is now possible\[1\] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the SHA-1 hash algorithm for less than USD$50K.
>
> <sup>\[1\] *SHA-1 is a Shambles: First Chosen-Prefix Collision on SHA-1 and Application to the PGP Web of Trust*  
> Leurent, G and Peyrin, T (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf></sup>

So the SHA-1 based RSA certificate algorithm is no longer considered secure. As a result,

> * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-keygen(1): this release removes the `ssh-rsa` (RSA/SHA1) algorithm from those accepted for certificate signatures (i.e. the client and server `CASignatureAlgorithms` option) and will use the `rsa-sha2-512` signature algorithm by default when the ssh-keygen(1) CA signs new certificates.

The immediate effect is, when you attempt to log in to a host that presents an RSA/SHA1 certificate, instead of logging in successfully, SSH will complain with the following message:

```text
check_host_cert: certificate signature algorithm ssh-rsa: signature algorithm not supported
```

and of course, you're again asked to trust the host key even if you've already trusted the `@cert-authority`.

This can be particularly annoying in larger organizations where the deployment of RSA/SHA1 certificates has spanned everywhere, and OpenSSH 8.2 essentially just broke them all.

Rest assured, there's a way to make everything go back to normal once more. But as suggested by OpenSSH, **you should not rely on this and should instead move away from `ssh-rsa` certificates soon**.

## Bring back the compatibility {#fix}

As described above, the value `ssh-rsa` has been dropped from the default list of the `CASignatureAlgorithms`, though as of April 8, the man page for `ssh_config(5)` contains a small mistake, which claims the default value of `CASignatureAlgorithms` is as follows:

```text
CASignatureAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-rsa
```

The actual value, of course, is the same as the above list with `ssh-rsa` stripped off, and all you need to do is to add it back.

If you just want to fix this for yourself, you can add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```text
Host *
  CASignatureAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-rsa
```

If you want to fix this for all users on a system, you can add the same lines to `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` instead, which will affect all `ssh` commands run on that system. **Remember this is still not recommended in favor of upgrating the signature algorithm.**

## Sign new certificates {#new-certificate}

You don't have to generate a new CA and deploy it everywhere. You can still use your RSA private key to generate new certificates for your machines, though it does require a little research first.
</div>

Let's start by looking at the man page for ssh-keygen(1).

```shell
ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I certificate_identity [-h] [-U] [-D pkcs11_provider] [-n principals] [-O option] [-V validity_interval] [-z serial_number] file ...
```

It doesn't look like there's a way to control the certificate algorithm. But hold on, have you tried the `-t` option that appears in many other subcommands...?

```shell
ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca -I Example -t rsa-sha2-256 id_rsa.pub
#                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

This will generate a new certificate at `id_rsa-cert.pub`. You might want to examine it at once, and you might probably be disappointed to see that it still begins with `ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com`.

**That simply doesn't matter.** To examine a certificate, you should use the `ssh-keygen -L` command:

```shell
ssh-keygen -Lf id_rsa-cert.pub
```

... and check its output:

```text
id_rsa-cert.pub:
        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com user certificate
        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:yP2N3uawwSuoJdww2miEYrsGuBictGYJ6VmkdhvtYcg
        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:yP2N3uawwSuoJdww2miEYrsGuBictGYJ6VmkdhvtYcg (using rsa-sha2-256)
        Key ID: "Example"
        Serial: 0
        Valid: forever
        Principals: (none)
        Critical Options: (none)
        Extensions:
                permit-X11-forwarding
                permit-agent-forwarding
                permit-port-forwarding
                permit-pty
                permit-user-rc
```

Notice how the fourth line reads `using rsa-sha2-256`? It's now signed with a different algorithm that's not considered deprecated anymore, which means it's ready to deploy.

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">
#### <i class="fas fa-fw fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip
{: .no_toc }

OpenSSH 8.2 defaults to using the `rsa-sha2-256` algorithm when signing new certificates with an RSA private key, so the `-t` option is only necessary if you're using OpenSSH 8.1 or older.
</div>

You can try running `ssh-keygen -L` on one of your old certificates to see how SSH describes it. This is left as a small quiz for you to figure out for yourself.
